Here's what people are saying about KISS!

> I just find it interesting that their version of simple includes dependency-tracking package management but excludes Spanish.

> Just wanted to say this looks kickass. It is way easier to tear things down than to build them.

> As a person who speaks Swedish, I feel that I must point out that “getkiss” translates to “goat pee.”

> I was looking for something like this actually, I thought I would finally have to warm up to BSD if I wanted an OS that I have some hope of understanding fully.

> I've got a basic installation done! It was actually quite simple! Not much is set up, but getting the base down was arguably simpler than Arch, and far simpler than Gentoo. I'm not really familiar with Busybox, or musl at all, so this should be fun!

> Keep making the biggest problem of Linux bigger, please... Yeah, this problem is "fragmentation", and it is not solved with "simplicity".

> Oh this touches something deep in me.

> "This distribution has no default desktop or window manager environment." - goes to prove that "simple" doesn't mean "easy to use"...

> This sounds awesome and very interesting. Going to have try this on one of my spare laptops....

> Just what we need, another Linux distribution. Spread the effort even more thinly.
