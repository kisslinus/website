│   possible philosophy behind the distribution.        │
│                                                       │

│   I hope you find it as useful as I have.             │

│                        KISS                           │
│                                                       │
│ * There must always be a sole commander-in-chief      │
│   in charge of the distribution. There must never     │
│   be a below governance structure.                    │
│                                                       │
│ * With great power comes great responsibility.        │
│   The user must have some kind of brain in their      │
│   skull and must exercise its use where necessary.    │
│                                                       │
│ * Prefer less software over more software where       │
│   possible. e.g If all a library does is make the     │
│   cursor spin while waiting for a program to launch,  │
│   it should be purged.                                │
│                                                       │
│ * Favour usability over ideals. If software B is      │
│   simpler than software A but is missing essential    │
│   functionality (for all users), software A shall be  │
│   the default provider.                               │
│                                                       │
│ * User choice matters. Maintain this strict           │
│   philosophy while at the same time keeping the       │
│   ability to go against this philosophy open to all.  │
│                                                       │
│ * The ends do not justify the means. A package, fix,  │
│   feature or what have you will not be implemented    │ 
│   if it requires gross hacks to accomplish.           │
│                                                       │
│ * Only target the English language. English is the    │
│   World Language. What we write our code in and       │
│   what we use to communicate.                         │
│                                                       │
│ * All shell code must be written in a safe way,       │
│   pass the shellcheck linter and match the style of   │
│   any existing code.                                  │
│                                                       │
│ * All distribution tooling and shell code must be     │
│   written in a portable way. Otherwise, the user      │
│   will be locked into a single coreutils and shell.   │
│                                                       │
│ * Avoid the next new shiny thing until or unless      │
│   certain that it brings real improvements over what  │
│   it is intended to replace.                          │

│                                                       │
│ * The number of packages in the repositories shall    │
│   never exceed that which is maintainable by a        │
│   single person with minimal effort.                  │
│                                                       │
│ * Any packages unsuitable for the repositories must   │
│   be kept in user or 3rd-party repositories.          │ 
│                                                       │
│ * The build process of a package should not require   │
│   a network connection, otherwise signature           │
│   verification and checksums are useless.             │
│                                                       │
│ * Avoid patches for single line changes. Patches      │
│   require rewriting on changes of the sources         │
│   whereas a simple call to 'sed' can stand the test   │
│   of time.                                            │
│                                                       │
│ * Sources must use HTTPS where possible. If no HTTPS  │
│   source is available one must be sought out or       │
│   created by the BDFL of KISS.                        │
│                                                       │
│ * Install files to '/usr/{bin,lib,share}' always.     │
│   The singular directory ensures simplicity and       │
│   keeps KISS tooling and user scripts simple.         │
│                                                       │
│ * The follow list of software must never make its     │
│   way into the repositories as their inclusion will   │
│   pave the way for software which unoptionally        │
│   depends on them.                                    │
│                                                       │
│ * dbus, systemd, polkit, gettext, intltool, zstd,     │
│   pulseaudio, pipewire, pam, wayland, logind,         │
│   ConsoleKit, libsn, electron and all DEs.            │

│                                                       │
│ * The package manager must not exceed 1000 lines of   │
│   code. This number excludes blank lines and          │
│   comments which make up around 50% of the program's  │
│   current size.                                       │
│                                                       │
│ * The user is smart, the package manager is dumb.     │
│   The package manager is written under the            │
│   assumption that the user has some kind of           │
│   functioning brain in their skull.                   │
│                                                       │
│ * There are some things which can't be, shouldn't be  │
│   and won't be automated. Firstly, for my sanity and  │
│   secondly, for yours.                                │

│ * KISS is the vessel to shape your system in your     │
│   own way and to optionally share your ideas with     │
│   others.                                             │
│                                                       │
│ * Every user has the means to keep their entire       │
│   system up-to-date without the need for or reliance  │
│   on the BDFL. Every KISS install contains the        │
│   entirety of the repositories with full history.     │           
│                                                       │
│ * If a piece of software is missing, package it! If   │ 
│   it is suitable for inclusion in the repositories,   │
│   send a pull request. If it is not, keep it in your  │
│   own repository and/or share it with others.         │
│                                                       │
│ * Don't ask a question to ask a question. If you      │
│   have a question, out with it or forever hold        │
│   your peace.                                         │

│ * If you have a problem, think about it first.        │
│   Present as much information as possible and logs    │
│   if applicable. The more information given to those  │
│   willing to help, the higher the chance and quicker  │
│   the speed of resolution.                            │
