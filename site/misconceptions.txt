The goal and idea behind this page is to document any misconceptions
about KISS, how things work, etc. Ideally, this will cover 
information not covered by the FAQ and other documentation.


* I must keep the linux-headers package in sync with my kernel's
  version to maintain a working system.

  The kernel headers in KISS are pinned to an LTS kernel version
  and are only updated when there are changes of interest in the
  kernel or headers themselves (usually by users requesting new
  features available in the newer headers).

  The headers are backwards compatible and are fully usable with a
  matching or NEWER kernel version. There are two cases where you'd
  be required to update the headers yourself.

  1. You'd like to run a kernel _older_ than the default headers.
  2. You'd like to make use of features in your _newer_ kernel version.

  Here's an excerpt from the kernel's documentation which may
  explain the situation better than I.

  > Kernel headers are backwards compatible, but not forwards 
    compatible. This means that a program built against a C library 
    using older kernel headers should run on a newer kernel (although 
    it may not have access to new features), but a program built 
    against newer kernel headers may not work on an older kernel.
