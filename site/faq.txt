* What init does KISS use?

  KISS uses busybox init by default. There is however, no lock-in and
  the user may use whatever they like. The distribution's boot up
  scripts are written in an init-agnostic way and act as a base for
  every init to use.


* What coreutils does KISS use?

  KISS uses busybox coreutils by default. There is however, no
  lock-in and the user may use whatever they like. All shell code is
  written in portable POSIX shell and coreutils invocations.

  * One exception is made for 'sed -i' which isn't POSIX but is far
    too useful to do away with. Many sed implementations include -i
    so this is more of a non-issue.

  * The tar command has no standard interface, however support is
    included for busybox tar, libarchive tar (bsdtar), GNU tar and
    others.
