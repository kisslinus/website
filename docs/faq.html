* Why should I use KISS?

  That's up to you to decide.

  I'm not going to try and sell you something I'm giving away for
  free. Have a read of the website and its wealth of information,
  try KISS in a virtual machine (a chroot is also an option) and
  come to your own conclusions.


* What does KISS mean?

  KISS is an acronym for "Keep it simple stupid" (notice _no_ comma).

  Stupid does not refer to the user. To quote Wikipedia:

  > The principle is best exemplified by the story of Johnson handing
    a team of design engineers a handful of tools, with the challenge
    that the jet aircraft they were designing must be repairable by
    an average mechanic in the field under combat conditions with
    only these tools.

  > Hence, the "stupid" refers to the relationship between the way
    things break and the sophistication available to repair them.

* Why isn't SOFTWARE packaged?

  No one has packaged it yet.


* Can you package SOFTWARE for me?

  Do it yourself.


* What init does KISS use?

  KISS uses busybox init by default. There is however, no lock-in and
  the user may use whatever they like. The distribution's boot up
  scripts are written in an init-agnostic way and act as a base for
  every init to use.


* What coreutils does KISS use?

  KISS uses busybox coreutils by default. There is however, no
  lock-in and the user may use whatever they like. All shell code is
  written in portable POSIX shell and coreutils invocations.

  * One exception is made for 'sed -i' which isn't POSIX but is far
    too useful to do away with. Many sed implementations include -i
    so this is more of a non-issue.

  * The tar command has no standard interface, however support is
    included for busybox tar, libarchive tar (bsdtar), GNU tar and
    others.

  * Some utilities have no standard specification and where their use
    is required, we adhere to common options between implementations.

  Barring the above exceptions, users are running KISS without the
  use of busybox. Popular alternatives are Suckless' sbase/ubase and
  GNU's set of core utilities.

* Why doesn't my kernel boot?

  The kernel not booting can be a variety of issues. This is almost
  always related to a configuration issue in the kernel, /etc/fstab
  or the bootloader.

  KISS doesn't use an initramfs so the configuration of the kernel
  may have different requirements to other distributions.

  1. The drivers for your disk controller, drives and filesystems
     must not be built as kernel modules. They should be set to =y
     in your .config or [*] when using make menuconfig.

     Essentially, every driver the kernel requires to detect and
     mount the drive containing the root filesystem, must be built
     as a part of the kernel binary.

  2. Multi-drive systems must use PARTUUID or UUID in place of
     /dev/sdXX in the bootloader configuration to ensure that the
     kernel will find the right drive.


* Why doesn't KISS support initramfs?

  KISS technically supports booting via an initramfs, it just doesn't
  require or provide one. As a user you have the means to set this up
  yourself for your system.

  Full disk encryption is also possible without the use of an
  initramfs in modern kernels (see dm-mod.create).

  The initramfs concept is an ugly, complicated and largely optional
  mess. Thank god it isn't a requirement.


* Why must I compile my own kernel?

  The kernel must be compiled by the user for a variety of reasons.

  1. The user maintains full control over all aspects of their kernel
     and further, their entire system. There is no lock-in into a
     specific set of kernel sources, version, use of proprietary
     firmware, patches, config, etc.

     The user decides:

     - Which kernel to use (sources and version).
     - When to update their kernel.
     - Whether to use proprietary firmware blobs.
     - Which patches to use (if any).
     - How the kernel is configured (endless options).
     - How many kernels they'd like to keep.
     - Compiler options (-O3, -march=native, etc).

     You as a user might actually learn something too. You may come
     to understand your hardware, what drivers it needs, how the
     kernel works from a configuration perspective, etc.

     You should have a better understanding of this part of the
     system afterwards and you'll be able fix any issues at this
     level with relative ease.

     Remember, it's only hard the first time. Once a working config
     is created, no further work should need to be done each time you
     update your kernel.

     If the new kernel version has an issue with your hardware,
     simply boot another from your backups. If new hardware was
     added, simply run 'make menuconfig' and add what is needed.

     I'll say what I always say. Nothing prevents anyone from
     providing kernel binaries and an initramfs generation tool for
     KISS. Just don't wait on the BDFL to do it for you.

  2. Eases distribution maintenance for the BDFL. Shipping a generic
     kernel demands a humongous, module heavy kernel with support for
     everything under the sun. An initramfs is then a requirement to
     boot this damn monstrosity.

     There is then a need for a _portable_ initramfs generation tool
     which to my knowledge doesn't exist. There can't be a dependence
     on bash or anything outside of core. All initramfs tools are
     either distribution-specific or non-portable to KISS.

     Then there'd be endless support requests for tweaks, additions
     and removals to the distribution config and the burden of
     updating the kernel on every release.

     Does KISS ship the latest kernel? The long term support kernel?
     Both? Some users require firmware so we'd need two separate
     binaries, one for linux-libre and another for regular linux.

     What if the latest kernel has issues on some hardware? New
     builds and binaries must be released with backported patches.

     It's a large maintenance burden for something which can simply
     be solved by the user doing this themselves. The user maintains
     full control over every aspect of their kernel and is solely
     responsible for it.

* C compiler cannot create executables.

  This is almost always an error in your CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS. Ensure that
  you have used -ONUM (CAPITAL O) and not (lowercase o) or (zero 0).

  If the above doesn't fix the issue, try building the package with
  CFLAGS= CXXFLAGS= LDFLAGS= kiss b pkg. You'll then be able to
  discern whether or not this was the issue.
