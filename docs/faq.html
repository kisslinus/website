* Why should I use KISS?

  That's up to you to decide.

  I'm not going to try and sell you something I'm giving away for
  free. Have a read of the website and its wealth of information,
  try KISS in a virtual machine (a chroot is also an option) and
  come to your own conclusions.


* What does KISS mean?

  KISS is an acronym for "Keep it simple stupid" (notice _no_ comma).

  Stupid does not refer to the user. To quote Wikipedia:

  > The principle is best exemplified by the story of Johnson handing
    a team of design engineers a handful of tools, with the challenge
    that the jet aircraft they were designing must be repairable by
    an average mechanic in the field under combat conditions with
    only these tools.

  > Hence, the "stupid" refers to the relationship between the way
    things break and the sophistication available to repair them.

* What init does KISS use?

  KISS uses busybox init by default. There is however, no lock-in and
  the user may use whatever they like. The distribution's boot up
  scripts are written in an init-agnostic way and act as a base for
  every init to use.


* What coreutils does KISS use?

  KISS uses busybox coreutils by default. There is however, no
  lock-in and the user may use whatever they like. All shell code is
  written in portable POSIX shell and coreutils invocations.

  * One exception is made for 'sed -i' which isn't POSIX but is far
    too useful to do away with. Many sed implementations include -i
    so this is more of a non-issue.

  * The tar command has no standard interface, however support is
    included for busybox tar, libarchive tar (bsdtar), GNU tar and
    others.

  * Some utilities have no standard specification and where their use
    is required, we adhere to common options between implementations.

  Barring the above exceptions, users are running KISS without the
  use of busybox. Popular alternatives are Suckless' sbase/ubase and
  GNU's set of core utilities.


* Why doesn't KISS support initramfs?

  KISS technically supports booting via an initramfs, it just doesn't
  require or provide one. As a user you have the means to set this up
  yourself for your system.

  Full disk encryption is also possible without the use of an
  initramfs in modern kernels (see dm-mod.create).

  The initramfs concept is an ugly, complicated and largely optional
  mess. Thank god it isn't a requirement.

* Why doesn't my kernel boot?

  The kernel not booting can be a variety of issues. This is almost
  always related to a configuration issue in the kernel, /etc/fstab
  or the bootloader.

  KISS doesn't use an initramfs so the configuration of the kernel
  may have different requirements to other distributions.

  1. The drivers for your disk controller, drives and filesystems
     must not be built as kernel modules. They should be set to =y
     in your .config or [*] when using make menuconfig.

     Essentially, every driver the kernel requires to detect and
     mount the drive containing the root filesystem, must be built
     as a part of the kernel binary.

  2. Multi-drive systems must use PARTUUID or UUID in place of
     /dev/sdXX in the bootloader configuration to ensure that the
     kernel will find the right drive.

|                              GCC                                  |
|                                                                   |

* C compiler cannot create executables.

  This is almost always an error in your CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS. Ensure that
  you have used -ONUM (CAPITAL O) and not (lowercase o) or (zero 0).

  If the above doesn't fix the issue, try building the package with
  CFLAGS= CXXFLAGS= LDFLAGS= kiss b pkg. You'll then be able to
  discern whether or not this was the issue.
