|                    TESTIMONIALS                       |
|                                                       |
|      Here's what people are saying about KISS!        |
|                                                       |
|                                                       |
| > I just find it interesting that their version of    |
|   simple includes dependency-tracking package         |
|   management but excludes Spanish.                    |
|                                                       |
| > Just wanted to say this looks kickass. It is way    |
|   easier to tear things down than to build them.      |
|                                                       |
| > As a person who speaks Swedish, I feel that I must  |
|   point out that “getkiss” translates to “goat pee.”  |
|                                                       |
| > I was looking for something like this actually,     |
|   I thought I would finally have to warm up to BSD    |
|   if I wanted an OS that I have some hope of          |
|   understanding fully.                                |
|                                                       |
| > Ooh, this is one of those artisan, hand-crafted     |
|   websites! I'll have to post this to my Instagram.   |
|   I once met an old web developer in the south of     |
|   France who would wash the bytes by hand before      |
|   uploading them to his server. Said it was a family  |
|   tradition passed down for generations.              |
|                                                       |
| > New logo needed. The chopped off head is bad luck   |
|   in parts of Asia.                                   |
|                                                       |
| > I've got a basic installation done! It was actually |
|   quite simple! Not much is set up, but getting the   |
|   base down was arguably simpler than Arch, and far   |
|   simpler than Gentoo. I'm not really familiar with   |
|   Busybox, or musl at all, so this should be fun!     |
|                                                       |
| > Keep making the biggest problem of Linux bigger,    |
|   please... Yeah, this problem is "fragmentation",    |
|   and it is not solved with "simplicity".             |
|                                                       |
| > Oh this touches something deep in me.               |
|                                                       |
| > "This distribution has no default desktop or        |
|   window manager environment." - goes to prove that   |
|   "simple" doesn't mean "easy to use"...              |
|                                                       |
| > This sounds awesome and very interesting. Going to  |
|   have try this on one of my spare laptops....        |
|                                                       |
| > Just what we need, another Linux distribution.      |
|   Spread the effort even more thinly.                 |
|                                                       |
| > Saw a link for this linux distribution, and         |
|   I've gotta say, the sexy logo makes this probably   |
|   not appropriate for adoption in a professional      |
|   environment. Nerds: read the goddamn room           |
|                                                       |
| > I spent some time on their website, and this        |
|   really is a wonder distribution.                    |
|                                                       |
| > Literally the opposite of KISS. At lest don't use   |
|   hypocritical excuses for your crusades.             |
|                                                       |
| > Hi! I just wanted to let you know that, while the   |
|   name is funny enough in English, it gets even       |
|   better in Swedish: "kiss" is a synonym for "piss",  |
|   and even the website translates to goatpiss.org.    |
|   Have a nice day!                                    |
|                                                       |
| > KISS Linux is a really interesting effort and a     |
|   sign, IMO, of a healthy ecosystem, so I commend     |
|   Dylan and other contributors for their efforts.     |
|   Great to hear about the aarch64/ppc64le support     |
|   too!                                                |
|                                                       |
| > Ok, what’s your point. You have have musl and libc  |
|   on a system. Not to mention the developer of kids   |
|   is a outspoken anti systemd fud spreader.           |
|                                                       |
| > The strength of being simple and small is that I'm  |
|   in control of my own system. When my package        |
|   manager or init daemon is doing something wrong, or |
|   is not behaving how I expected it, I can just open  |
|   the shell script and find out why in a few minutes. |
|                                                       |
| > One nice thing about KISS is that everything is     |
|   hackable and the system is small enough, such that  |
|   mere mortals can wrap their heads around it.        |
|                                                       |
| > Just as I thought. No actual simplicity, just some  |
|   neckbeards complaining about software evolving in   |
|   the last 20 years.                                  |
|                                                       |
|                                                       |
