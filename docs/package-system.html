|                                                       |
| * The distribution employs a package system based     |
|   around the concept of easily parseable plain-text   |
|   files (*separated by lines and spaces*).            |
|                                                       |
| * This format allows effortless interface using any   |
|   programming language or just basic UNIX tools.      |
|                                                       |

|                                                       |
| * The build file should contain all of the steps      |
|   necessary to patch, configure, make and install     |
|   ('make install' in this context) the package.       |
|                                                       |
| * The file is language agnostic and the only          |
|   requirement is that it be executable.               |
|                                                       |
| * On execution the script will start in the           |
|   directory of the package's source (no need to cd).  |
|                                                       |
| * The script is also given a single argument          |
|   (equivalent to 'script arg'), this argument         |
|   contains the path where the script should           |
|   install the compiled files.                         |
|                                                       |
| * Everything in the path is added to the package      |
|   tarball and later installed to the system.          |
|                                                       |
