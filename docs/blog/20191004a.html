To quote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama">Futurama</a> "When You Do Things Right, People Wonâ€™t Be Sure Youâ€™ve Done Anything at All". I've gone to great lengths for this silence.</p><h2 id="the-generation-process">The generation process</h2><p>This website is statically generated from a <a href="https://github.com/kisslinux/website/blob/master/make">simple shell script</a> using <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>, with every page written in basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a>.</p><p>As this site contains near zero images, I optimize each image by hand using <a href="https://compress-or-die.com/">Compress or Die</a> and load a <code>webp</code> or <code>jpg</code> image depending on browser support.</p><p>Every page shares the same CSS style-sheet and I also minify this by hand. I've found that a lot of CSS minifiers actually <em>increase</em> the file size.</p><h2 id="why-is-it-fast">Why is it fast?</h2><p>Every page is only <strong>a single HTTP request</strong>*. To achieve this, each page is entirely self-contained. A page is comprised of the HTML with the entirety of the CSS inlined in <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags.</p><p>As an example, the end result is a grand total of <strong>3.0KB</strong> for <a href="/">k1ss.org</a> all contained in a single HTTP request.</p><p><strong>*</strong> With the exception of the Screenshots page.</p><h2 id="analytics">Analytics</h2><p><strong>They don't belong here.</strong> I don't know how many people visit this website nor do I know anything about you!</p><p>Besides, it'd be unfair for me to browse the web with <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">Ublock Origin</a> plus JavaScript disabled and then <strong>track you</strong> on my site.</p><h2 id="removing-the-favicon">Removing the favicon</h2><p>The favicon has also been put to rest. This isn't as simple as not setting one! All of the major browsers will request a favicon <strong>even if one hasn't been set</strong>.</p><p>The workaround is to simply inline a favicon in each page. Through a lot of tinkering I have found the smallest inline favicon which ensures <strong>zero HTTP requests</strong>.</p><p>Behold: <code>&lt;link href=data:, rel=icon&gt;</code></p><p><strong>Update</strong></p><p>You may have noticed this site now has a favicon. You may have also noticed that each page is still only a single web request!</p><p>Through firing up <a href="http://grafx2.chez.com/">Grafx2</a> (<em>a pixel art editor</em>) and various optimization techniques I have created a simple favicon for the site.</p><p>This is a simple 4 color favicon (<em>1 color being the transparent background</em>) in <code>gif</code> format and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">base64</a> encoded to be embeddable in HTML.</p><pre><code>&lt;link href=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAQAPH/AAAAAP8AAP8AN////yH5BAUAAAQALAAAAAAQABAAAAM2SLrc/jA+QBUFM2iqA2bAMHSktwCCWJIYEIyvKLOuJt+wV69ry5cfwu7WCVp2RSPoUpE4n4sEADs=&quot; rel=icon&gt;</code></pre><p>I don't know if I'll keep this around or not, time will tell. Regardless, this was a fun excercise!</p><h2 id="fonts">Fonts</h2><p>No external fonts are in use. The body's <code>font-family</code> is set to <code>sans-serif</code> and will use whatever font is browser's default.</p><h2 id="javascript">JavaScript</h2><p>No JavaScript is used anywhere on the website. It isn't needed and is therefore omitted. Each page is strictly a document comprised of information.</p><h2 id="html">HTML</h2><p>The HTML is minified using a single <code>sed</code> command! I'll leave the dissection of the command to you, the reader. It's a fun exercise as <code>sed</code> is more powerful than people realise.</p><p>Behold: <code>sed ':a;N;$!ba;s|&gt;\s*&lt;|&gt;&lt;|g'</code></p><h2 id="css">CSS</h2><p>As mentioned above the CSS is inlined in each page inside <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags and it is minified by hand. I use various techniques to reduce its size.</p><p>All unnecessary white-space is removed (<code>ul{display:block}</code>). This is arguably the easiest minification step to do yourself.</p><p>Shorthand rules are used wherever possible (<code>font:</code> in place of <code>font-*</code> and <code>background:</code> in place of <code>background-*</code>). A lot of these are circumstantial.</p><p>Classes are avoided and IDs are instead used. This is actually a HTML minification technique (<code>id=a</code> vs <code>class=a</code>). It's even better if you're able to stick strictly to styling HTML tags!</p><p>All colors used on this site have a 3 character long shorthand. This enables the use of <code>#fff</code> instead of <code>#ffffff</code>. This is really easy to do if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Web-safe_colors">Web Safe Colors</a> are used.</p><p>The CSS on this website is still far from perfect however! The hardest minification technique (<em>at least for me</em>) is the <strong>removal</strong> of unused, unneeded or unapplied CSS rules. I'm still having fun with this one.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I will continue to chip away the source of this site, however diminishing the end results may be. This is just who I am. If there's wiggle room, I'll wiggle.</p><p>The full un-generated source for this website can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/kisslinux/website" class="uri">https://github.com/kisslinux/website</a></p><h2 id="get-in-touch">Get in touch</h2><p>If you have any further questions, feel free to <a href="/pages/contact">contact me</a>.</p><footer style='clear:both'><h3>Legal stuff</h3><div><p>The registered trademark LinuxÂ® is used pursuant to a sublicense from the Linux Foundation, the exclusive licensee of Linus Torvalds, owner of the mark on a worldÂ­wide basis.</p><p>Â© <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps">Dylan Araps</a> 2019-2020</p></div></footer></main>
