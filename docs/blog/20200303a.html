Subject	This week in KISS (#13)
From	Dylan Araps &lt;dylan@k1ss.org&gt;
Date	Tue, 3 Mar 2020 12:07:09 +0100

Hello all.

This week I worked on slimming down the official repositories. The
official repositories no longer require, libnl, automake, autoconf,
libtool, python-mako and others.

</a>

Perl is now an optional dependency and is only required when building
Firefox or libvpx. The kernel also requires perl though there are
patches available for removing this requirement.

YASM is now also an optional dependency and NASM is used everywhere.
The only package which requires YASM during builds is Firefox which
is optionally also available as a binary through firefox-bin.

The installation guide will be updated once GCC 10 is released to
include the kernel changes above and how to avoid perl.

I also worked on removing libxdg-basedir from picom and my patch
was accepted and merged upstream [1]. This library is tiny, 
unmaintained and doesn't see much use anymore.

WYVERKISS 0.2 released

Wyverkiss is an alternative root-fs tarball created by Konimex which
uses LLVM/clang as the default compiler. This extends to removing as
much GNU as possible.

This isn't an officially supported project so any bugs should be
reported to the wyverkiss repository. I thought I'd post about it
regardless as it is KISS related and may be of some interest to you.

To quote the README:

 "Wyverkiss is an alternative rootfs for KISS Linux. If KISS goes 
  GNU, we go the opposite."

DOCS

Every KISS install now optionally includes the distribution's 
documentation (in /usr/share/doc/kiss). This was done for a couple 
of reasons. 

1) It removes the network requirement for the docs and enables the
   user to read them locally.. 

2) It's another means of ensuring that the docs outlive the website
   were it to go down.

The files themselves take up no space at all as they're merely plain
.txt files. With this change, every KISS user has the entire distro 
stored locally on their system.

This was fairly simple to achieve as the repositories are git based
and contain full history, the package manager is written in shell
so the installed program _is_ the source code and the docs are 
little .txt files.

Were something to happen to me (knock on wood!), there is now nothing 
to lose access to. Every KISS user has the ability to continue to
keep their system up to date and to additionally keep KISS alive.

Remember, the distribution is designed to be maintainable by a single
person. You have the right and means as a user to drop the dependence
on me at any time.


BIRCH

I spent some time working on my IRC client as well. I rewrote it from
the ground up and it's now in a "ready" state. Documentation is still
lacking which I will tackle over the next week.

A little introduction first. Birch is an IRC client written in 
around 200 lines of bash (excluding blank lines and comments).

<a href="/images/weekly/birch.jpg">
    <img src="/images/weekly/birch.jpg" alt="irc client">
</a>

Interesting features include:

- Full readline prompt ('read -e') with support for tab completion of
  nicks, channels, etc and support for keybindings, message history
  and all readline keybindings.

- Buffers and a tabline split into server, channels and users. The
  <Ctrl+n> keybind can be used to cycle through buffers.

- Pretty printing of output. Nicks are colored based on their length
  and the display is what I would call "pretty".


These may seem pretty basic to you as a reader though keep in mind
that bash is very tricky to work with when it comes to writing any
kind of TUI.

The trickiest part is that the input prompt and IRC listener must run
asynchronously and small portions of the window must be updated
without affecting other parts of the window.

So, the listener runs in the background. When you background
something in bash, it runs in a subshell. What this means is that you
can no longer share variables between the now separate processes.

This made it very hard to communicate between input/output. I ended
up using files for IPC which turned out great for logging purposes.
Lots of fun to be had.

I know I'll get this question: "Why bash?". I'll answer as simply as
possible. It's fun and challenging!

POW

I also spent a little time writing a simple and barebones laptop
power management tool called pow. It merely provides two commands,
'pow pow' to swap to power (AC) and 'pow bat' to swap to battery.

On my hardware the battery mode passes all of powertop's tunable
nitpicks though more rules may need to be added for yours. Patches
are welcome.

This tool provides no daemon to listen to AC/Battery events. It only
provides the switching mechanism. It's up to you how, when and why
it should be run.

There is no configuration file either as the program is so tiny. Once
edits are made and it works, there's no real need to ever touch it
again.

As an example, you could pair this with acpid to automatically run it
on specific events. I hope you find some use out of it, I have!

SOWM

SOWM is a simple window manager of my creation and is the closest
thing to a "default" window manager in a KISS system. It comes in at
around 200 LOC and is extendable through patches.

<a href="/images/weekly/sowm.jpg">
    <img src="/images/weekly/sowm.jpg" alt="window manager">
</a>

The patch process for SOWM has changed to a more maintainable system.
Each patch is now a pull request on GitHub which will be kept open in
perpetuity.

The author of the pull request will know when there are merge 
conflicts as the web-UI won't allow the PR to be merged. GitHub also
allows patches to be generated by appending '.patch' to the PR URL.

I also worked on adding basic titlebar support to SOWM. They're 
pretty useless right now though I'll be extending the patch to add
title text, buttons, etc. It's a start.
