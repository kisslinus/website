This ended up becoming an impossibility due to two offending packages, Firefox and NodeJS (<em>a build dependency of the former</em>).</p><p>We are nearing the day that Python 2 reaches EOL (<em>end of life</em>) and as is usually the case with deadlines, it has been left to the last minute. Python 2's end has been known as far back as 2010 (<em>possibly sooner</em>) and yet I foresee it being used well past 2020. [0]</p><p><strong>Firefox</strong></p><p>Firefox's build process depends on both Python 2 and Python 3. Mozilla is currently in the process of converting their Python code to support <strong>both</strong> 2 and 3.</p><p>This effort only recently started and there is a long road ahead to completion.</p><blockquote><p>In mozilla-central there are over <strong>3500 Python files</strong> (excluding third party files), comprising roughly <strong>230k lines of code</strong>. Additionally there are <strong>462 repositories</strong> labelled with Python in the Mozilla org on Github [...] [1]</p></blockquote><p>Will Mozilla finish before the deadline? It doesn't look that way.</p><blockquote><p>Do we need to be 100% migrated by Python 2â€™s EOL? Technically, no. [...] [1]</p></blockquote><p><strong>NodeJS</strong></p><p>Node is in a similar position to Mozilla, work is being done but to say it is nearing completion is an overstatement. NodeJS is closer to being Python 3 compatible than Firefox but I myself doubt that we will see a release with support by 2020.</p><p><strong>The Future</strong></p><p>It is looking more and more like we will be using Python 2 for a while longer. Despite the decade or near decade long time for transition these projects have left the transition till beyond the EOL date.</p><p>Since the EOL announcement till today how much Python 2 code has been added to these two projects? A transition even 5 years ago would've been beneficial!</p><p>So it looks like KISS will keep Python 2 in the official repositories past 2019 and into 2020.</p><p><strong>Sources:</strong></p><ul><li>[0] https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2010-May/099971.html</li><li>[1] https://ahal.ca/blog/2019/python-3-at-mozilla/</li></ul><footer style='clear:both'><h3>Legal stuff</h3><div><p>The registered trademark LinuxÂ® is used pursuant to a sublicense from the Linux Foundation, the exclusive licensee of Linus Torvalds, owner of the mark on a worldÂ­wide basis.</p><p>Â© <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps">Dylan Araps</a> 2019-2020</p></div></footer></main>
